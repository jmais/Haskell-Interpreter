Instructions on running the Project:

cabal build (just build the project)
cabal run tests/test*.pas (run and build project replace asterisk with # of test you would like to run)

All aspects of the project are fully functional except for functions not retunring values or allowing parameters,
The break and continue keywords do not work , and case statements are not funcitonal.
Varibales can be created in a new scope but if that variable does not exist in the previous scope it will not be carried over.
